title: "About Me"
---

Hi, I'm Rabin. I help turn data and backend systems into reliable, production-ready solutions: ML models (especially in sports), live trading analytics, data pipelines, and financial insights.

I care about building things that actually work in production: modular architectures, clear data flows, and analytics that support real decisions. With a mix of software development (Python, R, SQL) and statistical/risk analysis from my time in fintech and now a Master of Data Science at UBC, I like bridging clean engineering with data-driven outcomes.

My background includes a **Master of Data Science** (expected 2026) from the University of British Columbia and a **Bachelor's in Actuarial Science** from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, plus 4+ years building backend services and doing data transformation and risk analytics. That's given me a solid footing in both systems and stats.

**What I Work On:**

- **Data transformation & analytics** — Turning large datasets into clear insights, dashboards, and reports
- **Machine learning** — From feature engineering and model selection to evaluation and interpretation in real-world contexts
- **Backend & data pipelines** — Building and maintaining production services and pipelines that power analytics and reporting
- **Automation & tooling** — Scripts, packages, and workflows that make repetitive tasks reliable and repeatable
- **Evidence-driven decisions** — Using data, testing, and clear metrics to guide what we build and how we improve

Always happy to connect and chat about data, ML, backend systems, or sports. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rabindranath-duran-pons-1682591ab/)
