    "text": "Hi, I’m Rabin. I help turn data and backend systems into reliable, production-ready solutions: ML models (especially in sports), live trading analytics, data pipelines, and financial insights.\nI care about building things that actually work in production: modular architectures, clear data flows, and analytics that support real decisions. With a mix of software development (Python, R, SQL) and statistical/risk analysis from my time in fintech and now a Master of Data Science at UBC, I like bridging clean engineering with data-driven outcomes.\nMy background includes a Master of Data Science (expected 2026) from the University of British Columbia and a Bachelor’s in Actuarial Science from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, plus 4+ years building backend services and doing data transformation and risk analytics. That’s given me a solid footing in both systems and stats.\nWhat I Work On:\n\nData transformation & analytics — Turning large datasets into clear insights, dashboards, and reports\nMachine learning — From feature engineering and model selection to evaluation and interpretation in real-world contexts\nBackend & data pipelines — Building and maintaining production services and pipelines that power analytics and reporting\nAutomation & tooling — Scripts, packages, and workflows that make repetitive tasks reliable and repeatable\nEvidence-driven decisions — Using data, testing, and clear metrics to guide what we build and how we improve\n\nAlways happy to connect and chat about data, ML, backend systems, or sports."
