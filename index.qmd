## About Me

Hi, I'm Rabin. I help turn data and backend systems into reliable, production-ready solutions: ML models (especially in sports), live trading analytics, data pipelines, and financial insights.

I care about building things that actually work in production: modular architectures, clear data flows, and analytics that support real decisions. With a mix of software development (Python, R, SQL) and statistical/risk analysis from my time in fintech and now a Master of Data Science at UBC, I like bridging clean engineering with data-driven outcomes.

My background includes a **Master of Data Science** (expected 2026) from the University of British Columbia and a **Bachelor's in Actuarial Science** from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, plus 4+ years building backend services and doing data transformation and risk analytics. That's given me a solid footing in both systems and stats.

**What I Work On:**

- **Data transformation & analytics** — Turning large datasets into clear insights, dashboards, and reports
- **Machine learning** — From feature engineering and model selection to evaluation and interpretation in real-world contexts
- **Backend & data pipelines** — Building and maintaining production services and pipelines that power analytics and reporting
- **Automation & tooling** — Scripts, packages, and workflows that make repetitive tasks reliable and repeatable
- **Evidence-driven decisions** — Using data, testing, and clear metrics to guide what we build and how we improve

Always happy to connect and chat about data, ML, backend systems, or sports. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rabindranath-duran-pons-1682591ab/)

## Projects

::: {.project-cards}
::: {.project-card}
**[NHL Hockey Game Prediction](https://github.com/rabin0208/hockey_modelling_moneyline)**  
ML project to predict NHL game outcomes. End-to-end pipeline: fetch data from the NHL API and Natural Stat Trick, build features (win rates, goal differentials, recent form, advanced metrics), train and tune multiple models (logistic regression, Random Forest, gradient boosting), and predict upcoming games with win probabilities and implied odds.

**[Baseball Moneyline](https://github.com/rabin0208/baseball_moneyline)**  
ML project to predict MLB game winners using pybaseball and the MLB Stats API. Covers sport-specific features (e.g. pitchers, matchups) and a similar pipeline to the hockey project: data ingestion, feature building, model training with scikit-learn, and results stored for analysis.
